        artificial intelligence, algorithms, and secure programming. My final
        year dissertation focused on researching, designing, and implementing a
        secure chat server which expanded my knowledge of cryptography, secure
        programming techniques, and cyber security. My dissertation culminated

        Prior I worked alongside a Welsh Government organisation to deliver
        critical national infrastructure related to flood warnings. In this
        project, one of the areas I was responsible for was developing a
        resilient message delivery system capable of sending over 40,000
        messages across three different channels in under an hour. I also played
        a key role in optimising the message creation processâ€”reducing the time
        taken from tens of minutes to just tens of seconds.{" "}
